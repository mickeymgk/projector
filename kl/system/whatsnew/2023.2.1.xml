            <p>
               To help developers build more adaptive and accessible UI in Jetpack Compose, Android
               Studio Iguana Canary 5 introduced a new UI Check mode in Compose Preview. This
               feature works similar to <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/past-releases/as-electric-eel-release-notes#visual-linting">Visual Linting</a>
               and <ahref="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/testing#accessibility-scanner ">Accessibility checks integrations</a>
               for views. Activate Compose UI check mode for Android Studio to automatically audit
               your Compose UI and check for adaptive and accessibility issues across different
               screen sizes, such as text stretched on large screens and low color contrast. The
               mode highlights issues found in different Preview configurations and lists them in
               the problems panel.

            <p>
               Progressive Rendering in Compose Preview is a part of continual effort to make
               Compose previews more performant. For any preview that is out of view, their
               render quality is now purposely lowered to save memory used. This feature is
               developed with the goal to further improve the usability of Previews.

               Generate Baseline Profiles for your app using the <b>Baseline Profile Generator</b>
               template in the new module wizard (<b>File > New > New Module</b>). The template sets
               up your project so that it can support Baseline Profiles. It also creates a run
               configuration that lets you create a Baseline Profile with one click.

               Use the Espresso Device API to test your app when the device undergoes common
               configuration changes, such as rotation and screen unfolding. The Espresso Device API
               lets you simulate these configuration changes on a virtual device and executes your
               tests synchronously so the test results are reliable.

              Android Studio Iguana supports Gradle Version Catalogs, a
              feature that lets you manage dependencies in one central location and share
              dependencies across modules or projects. Android Studio now makes it easier to
              configure version catalogs through editor support and integration with the
              <b>Project Structure</b> dialog.

               Android Studio displays lint warnings in build files and in the Project Structure
               Dialog for public SDKs that have Play policy violations in the Google Play SDK Index.
               You should update any dependencies that violate Play policies because these
               violations could prevent you from publishing to the Google Play Console in the
               future.

               Android Studio displays a warning if your project uses a <code>compileSdk</code>
               version that isn't supported by the current version of Android Studio. If available,
               it also suggests moving to a version of Android Studio that supports the compileSdk

               When you run lint on a module, separate lint analysis tasks are run for the main and
               test components of the module to improve performance. To revert to the earlier
               behavior, set <code>android.experimental.lint.analysisPerComponent=false</code> in
               your <code>gradle.properties</code> file.
